Gerald!
I took a look at the proposed changes and also spoke with my counterpart at Cargill, we are fine with the changes.  Please execute a guaranty in the amount of $8MM.

SUBJECT: Cargill Guaranty
Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:
1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.
2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.
I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
