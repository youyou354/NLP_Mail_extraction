Subject:	Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications
We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions for ENA's NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.
Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate account).
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.
